# ProgrammableIoTEnvironmentChamber
An environment chamber helps with space agriculture research.

## Project Statement
The objective is to provide an environmental chamber for agricultural research in space. The chamber allows the user to control the environmental conditions such as light, temperature, and humidity. This means that the user would be able to maximize the growth of plants by simulating the ideal conditions that would not be available in the surrounding environment. The user would also be able to simulate shorter growing seasons for their plants. This project is a solution that gives humans an opportunity to research growing sustainable crops in a controlled environment.
